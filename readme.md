#### Starter code

After forking this repo, clone it to your computer and **import** the starter-code folder.

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this lab you will be using what you have learned so far about Views and Layouts to recreate a layout given to you. This is common practice in the Android developer field.

**This looks like a lot. It is, but it is a lot of repetition.**

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Recreate the screen you see on the board.
- There has to be two TextViews and one Button vertically oriented.
- The first and second TextViews should say "This is TextView number " and then the number of the TextView
- The first TextView has a text size of 26sp, and a text style of bold
- The second TextView has a text size of 22sp, and a text style of italic
- The button has a text that just says button.
- When a user taps on the button it should display a Toast message that says, "You clicked on the button below views number " and appended/concatenated to the end of that `String` should be the number of the views (Example: "You clicked on the button below views number 1 and 2")

**Bonus:**
- What is a less repetitive way of doing this?

#### Deliverable

Pull request from forked Project on GitHub that contains your implementation of the requirements.
